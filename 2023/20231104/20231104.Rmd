1. Simulators have emerged as a general problem-solving device across various domains, many of which now have rich, open-source libraries.
2. Where is the interface with statistics?

### Grammar of Generative Models

Transparent simulators can be built by interactively composing simple modules. Probabilistic programming has simplified the process.

### Discrepancy and Iterability

By learning a discriminator to contrast real vs. simulated data, we can systematically improve the assumed generative mechanism.

### Experimental Design Renaissance

Let's consider a microbiomics case study: To block or not to block?

* Blocking removes person-level effects...
* ...but increases participant burden.

### Simulation to the Rescue

How can we navigate trade-offs like this? Simulate!

Simulators provide data for more precise decision-making.

### Covasim

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the research community came together to build simulators that could inform pandemic response.
* E.g., "What would happen if we held classes remotely for two weeks?"

### Covasim

Covasim is an example of an agent-based model. Starting from local interaction
rules, it lets us draw global inferences.

Statistical emulators mimic the relationship between input hyperparameters and
output data, substantially reducing the computational burden.

### Conclusion

 We have many more examples, like the evolution of mimicry in butterflies, longitudinal study design, the duality between agents and particles, …

* Code (R + Python + NetLogo): [https://go.wisc.edu/7222i9](https://go.wisc.edu/7222i9)

**Inference and imagination**: Statistical calibration grounds us in reality while generative tinkering encourages us to imagine.
