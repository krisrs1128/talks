### Why Simulate?

* **Experimental Design**: We have to decide on cohorts, longitudinal sampling plans, and sequencing technologies, not to mention sample sizes.

* **Benchmarking**: They allow us to benchmark algorithms even when ground truth labels are unavailable.

* **Data Augmentation**: Simulated samples can improve algorithmic performance and integration.

* **Calibration**: Statistical performance on simulated data can help us calibrate workflows to improve power and control the false discovery rate.

### A Grand Challenge

*Many single-cell data analysis packages include their own ad hoc data simulators [111, 211, 241, 264, 349–353]. However, these simulators are usually not available as separate tools or even as a source code, tailored to specific problems studied in corresponding papers and sometimes not comprehensively documented, thus limiting their utility for the broad research community.*

-- Challenge 11 from "Eleven grand challenges in single-cell data science" `r Citep(bib, "Lhnemann2020ElevenGC")`.

---

### That's a Bit Uncharitable

1. It's true that most researchers do not routinely use simulation. The issue
isn't sloppiness in sharing or documenting code, though.

1. The deeper issues are:

  * Interfaces often suffer from large interaction gulfs `r Citep(bib, "Hutchins1985-oz")`. It is hard to specify simulators and iterate.

### That's a Bit Uncharitable

1. It's true that most researchers do not routinely use simulation. The issue
isn't sloppiness in sharing or documenting code, though.

1. The deeper issues are:
  * We usually view simulators as monolithic. We can
  adjust parameters but can't interchange components. This makes them hard to
  adapt to new technologies or applications.

The rest of the talk will be about using these principles to develop a new
version of `scDesign3`. Let's review that package's approach.

.center[

First, we estimate models $\hat{F}_{g}\left(y_{i} \vert \mathbf{x}_{i}\right)$ for each gene $g$.

* Can use a variety of families: Gaussian, Poisson, Negative Binomial,...
* Can learn relationships for each parameter $\theta\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)$.

## Interface Design
]

---

### Nouns & Verbs

We can break the interface design question into two parts.

1. **Data Structures**: How can we represent the simulator in a way that is both
transparent to a human and precise enough for a computer?

1. **Operations**: How can we encourage users to study and tinker with the data
structures?

If the resulting grammar is expressive enough, then researchers will be able to
solve problems we may not have anticipated.

```{r, read_data, echo = FALSE}
sce <- readRDS(url("https://go.wisc.edu/77uf3h"))[1:10, ]
```

---

### Nouns: Gene-Level Models

For each gene, we can specify the regression formula and distributional family.

```{r, setup_margins}
margins <- setup_margins(sce, ~ ns(pseudotime, 3),  ~ ZINBLSS())
margins
```

```{r, estimate_margins, echo = FALSE}
margins <- estimate(margins, sce)
```

---

### Nouns: Copula Models

We can tie together a collection of marginals using a copula model.

```{r join_into_copula}
simulator <- new(
  "JointDistribution",
  margins = margins,
  dependence = copula_gaussian()
)
```

We can support different correlation structures across groups.

```{r modified_copula}
simulator <- new(
  "JointDistribution", 
  margins = margins, 
  dependence = copula_gaussian(~ cell_type)
)
```

```{r wrap_into_simulator, echo = FALSE}
simulator <- setup_simulator(
  sce,
  ~ ns(pseudotime, 3),
  ~ ZINBLSS(),
  copula = copula_gaussian()
) |>
  estimate()
```

---

### Extensibility

For the marginals, we can borrow from existing LSS packages `r Citep(bib, c("Rigby2005GeneralizedAM", "Hofner2014gamboostLSSAR"))` to implement gene-wise regressions,

* Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson, Binomial, Negative-Binomial, Zero-Inflated Poisson, Zero Inflated Negative Binomial,…

We can also build a unified interface to various copula estimation routines,

* Vine copulas for capturing higher-order moments.
* Gaussian and Student-t copulas with standard sample covariance, shrunken covariance, or graphical lasso precision estimates.
* `copula_vine(), copula_adaptive(), copula_glasso(), ...`

### Verbs: <span style="color: #D94E4E">Plot</span>
```{r, echo = FALSE}
line_opts <- list(col = "#8C2E62", linewidth = 2)
ribbon_opts <- list(col = "#8C2E62", alpha = 0.1)
point_opts <- list(size = 0.4, alpha = 0.3)
```

```{r example_plot, out.width = 800}
plot(simulator, "pseudotime", line_opts = line_opts, ribbon_opts = ribbon_opts, point_opts = point_opts) +
  facet_wrap(~ feature, ncol = 4)
```

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Mutate</span>

`mutate` lets you modify a few elements from a larger simulator.

```{r second_alteration, out.width = 800}
altered <- mutate(margins, Chga:Ins1, link = ~ pseudotime) |>
  estimate(sce)
```
```{r plot_alteration, out.width = 800, echo = FALSE}
plot(altered, sce, "pseudotime", line_opts = line_opts, ribbon_opts = ribbon_opts, point_opts = point_opts) +
  facet_wrap(~ feature, ncol = 4, scales = "free_y")
```

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Mutate</span>

We can layer several changes on top of one another. Syntax color highlights
modifications that haven’t been re-fit.


```{r, layered_alteration}
margins |>
  mutate(Chga:Ins1, link = ~ pseudotime) |>
  mutate(c("Pyy", "Rbp4"), family = ~ GaussianLSS()) |>
  mutate(Iapp, link = list(mu = ~ ns(pseudotime, df = 5), sigma = ~ 1, nu = ~ 1))
```

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Mutate</span>

1. Here is a more realistic example from a longitudinal microbiome study.

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Join</span>

We should make it possible to combine simulators like Lego blocks.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
SCGEMMETH_sce <- readRDS(url("https://go.wisc.edu/q712e3"))
SCGEMRNA_sce <-readRDS(url("https://go.wisc.edu/9n6u1y"))

rownames(SCGEMMETH_sce) <- make.names(rownames(SCGEMMETH_sce))
rownames(SCGEMRNA_sce) <- make.names(rownames(SCGEMRNA_sce))
```

```{r illustrate_joins}
experiments <- list(methylation = SCGEMMETH_sce, rna = SCGEMRNA_sce)
families <- list(~ BI(), ~ GaussianLSS())
sims <- experiments |>
  map2(families, \(x, y) setup_simulator(x, ~ cell_type, y))
```

<img src="figures/simulator_join_motivation.png"/>

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Join</span> (Copula)

One approach is to merge the list of marginal distributions and re-estimate the joint distribution.

```{r, join_simulators_glasso, eval = FALSE}
sim_joined <- map(sims, estimate, nu = 0.1) |>
  join_copula(copula_glasso())
```

This assumes that we have samples where all features are measured.

.center[
<img src="figures/copula_join.png" width = 680/>
]

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Join</span> (Conditioning)

Alternatively, we can combine two simulators by conditioning them on shared latent structure.

```{r join_simulators}
sim_joined <- join_pamona(sims)
```

.center[
<img src="figures/simulator_join.png" width = 800/>
]

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#025E73">Join</span> (Conditioning)

This used partial manifold alignment `r Citep(bib, "Cao2020ManifoldAF")` to
learn shared latent variables across assays and works even in the diagonal
integration setting.

```{r print_joined}
sim_joined
```

### Example 2: Power Analysis

With a given sample size and experimental design, what types of signals will be recoverable?

  * This prevents wasting effort on underpowered studies.
  * In practice, researchers often report power for tests with analytical power curves (e.g., $t$-tests), even if that is not the planned analysis.

Simulation can guide power analysis that reflects the planned analysis approach.

---

### Problem Context

`r Citep(bib, "Gavin2018")` studied the metaproteomics of Type I Diabetes (T1D).
.pull-left[
* They sampled participants at several disease stages (33 with T1D, 17 at high risk, 29 at low risk, 22 healthy)
* Their analysis used sPLS-DA `r Citep(bib, "LCao2011")`, a variant of linear discriminant analysis.
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/gavin_t1d_summary.png" width=500/>
]

They found that intestinal and pancreas function are altered even before the onset of full T1D.


---

### Multivariate Power Analysis

What would be a good power analysis for a follow-up study?

1. Estimation: Learn a simulator from the 101 available samples.
2. Perturbation: Generate data with varying sample sizes and signals.
3. Evaluation: Compute the average sPLS-DA performance across replicates.

.center[
<img src="figures/power_overview.png" width=700/>
]

---

### Estimation

1. We fit Gaussian LSS models to log-ratio transformed measurements of the 427 proteins found in $\geq$ 70% of subjects.
2. Means and variances are allowed to vary across low- and high-risk groups.
3. Main difficulty: The real data have long left tails.

.center[
<img src="figures/t1D-multivariate-0.png", width=800/>
]

---

### Perturbation

.pull-left[
* We `mutate` the simulators so that the true number of T1D-associated proteins is $s \in \{10, 30, \dots, 90\}$
* We choose the true non-nulls from among proteins with observed strong effects
  - 32 are found significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ in the original data
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/p_values.png"/>
]

---

### Evaluation

* The AUC for tuned sPLS-DA models varies from 0.5 (random guess) to over 0.9 in the high-signal regime.

* Potential Extension: Model patient heterogeneity (age, finer risk levels).

---

### Verbs: <span style="color:#D94E4E">Mutate</span>

There are many reasons we might want to alter an initial simulator,
* **Synthetic Nulls**: We can define negative controls to safeguard against false discoveries.
* **Iteration**: We may want to improve the simulator’s goodness of fit by modifying the regression.
* **Power Analysis**: We may want to construct data from alternative experimental designs or biological signal strengths.

---

### <span style="color:#025E73">Modularity</span> - Augment

Another way to alter a simulator is to make implicit data explicitly available,
in the spirit of the broom package's `augment`.

For example, these data appear to have mouse-level effects.

.center[
<img src="figures/subject_effect_real.png" width=750/>
]

---

### <span style="color:#025E73">Modularity</span> - Augment

1. Unfortunately, none of the packages we use at the marginal estimation step support random effects.

1. We defined an `augment` function that defines a simple proxy,

    * Compute sample-wise low-dimensional multidimensional scaling coordinates $z_{i}$.
    * For mouse $s$, condition on its average coordinates: $F_{g}\left(y_{ig} \vert x_{i}, \bar{z}_{s\left(i\right)}\right)$
    * Use with caution: The $z_{i}$ will be correlated with the diet effect.

.large-code[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
exper <- augment_mds(exper, K = 4) |>
  groupwise_average(starts_with("MDS"), MouseID)
```
]

---

### <span style="color:#025E73">Modularity</span> - Augment

* Compute sample-wise low-dimensional multidimensional scaling coordinates $z_{i}$.
* For mouse $s$, condition on its average coordinates: $F_{g}\left(y_{ig} \vert x_{i}, \bar{z}_{s\left(i\right)}\right)$
* Use with caution: The $z_{i}$ will be correlated with the diet effect.

### Example: Multi-omics Power Analysis

1. In practice, most power analyses are univariate, e.g., to guide differential expression.
2. How should we do multivariate power analysis, especially with several tables?

---

### Example

Let’s consider the microbiome + metabolome mouse study from `r Citep(bib, "Callahan2016BioconductorWF")`. This had 12 samples.
1. How does estimation quality improve with sample size?
2. Is it worth gathering unpaired samples? (mosaic designs)

.center[
<img src="figures/cca_f1000.gif" width=650/>
]

---

### Example: Estimate Simulators

1. Fit ZINB models to the microbiome.
2. Fit Gaussian models to the metabolome.
3. Join them using highly regularized covariance estimates.

### Part 2: Hypothetical Experiments
.pull-left[
1. Across sample sizes $n$, we simulate new data, fit sparse CCA, and identify a
basis $\hat{V}_{n}$ spanning the $K = 5$ left and right sparse CCA factors
1. We use $\hat{V}_{5000}$ as a reference and compute canonical angles `r Citep(bib, "Golub1994PerturbationAO")` with all smaller sample sizes.

### Mosaic Case

Here, we have allowed the sample sizes to differ and use KNN imputation to run
CCA on an imputed table.

### Aside: Negative Control
The default sPLS-DA visualization output can separate classes even when no signals exist. This is a consequence of overfitting.

### Future Directions: Improving Generators

.pull-left[
GAMLSS models are simple and interpretable. However,

* They can oversmooth sharp transitions.
* Fitting each feature separately is both statistically and computationally inefficient.

### Future Directions: Quantitative Evaluation

.pull-left[
We need formal ways for gauging the quality of a simulator.

* Existing evaluation criteria for simulated omics data rely on ad-hoc summaries.
* GAN precision-recall measures can offer a more systematic approach `r Citep(bib, "Sajjadi2018AssessingGM")`.

### Future Directions: Autocompletion

* Many parameters can influence simulation quality: Preprocessing, distributional assumptions, covariates to include, spline basis
* Can we "recommend" the next step of simulator construction, based on initial user specification `r Citep(bib, "Heer2019")`?
