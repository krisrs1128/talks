abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

We take a Bayesian approach, generating an appropriate prior via a distribution on partitions that we refer to as the nested Chinese restaurant process. This nonparametric prior allows arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates growing data collections. We build a hierarchical topic model by combining this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation. We illustrate our approach on simulated data and with an application to the modeling of NIPS abstracts.},

              The growth of available metagenome data and the use of exact,

              datasets of variable 16S rRNA regions, we demonstrate the
              presence of a lower-dimensional structure in the microbiome
              space, with high-dimensional data concentrated near a
              low-dimensional non-linear submanifold, but the absence of
              distinct and stable clusters that could represent enterotypes.

               categorized individuals into 'enterotypes' or clusters based on
               the abundances of key bacterial genera in the gut microbiota.
               There is a lack of consensus, however, on the analytical basis
               for enterotypes and on the interpretation of these results. We
               tested how the following factors influenced the detection of
               enterotypes: clustering methodology, distance metrics,
               OTU-picking approaches, sequencing depth, data type (whole
               genome shotgun (WGS) vs.16S rRNA gene sequence data), and 16S
               rRNA region. We included 16S rRNA gene sequences from the Human
               Microbiome Project (HMP) and from 16 additional studies and WGS
               sequences from the HMP and MetaHIT. In most body sites, we
               observed smooth abundance gradients of key genera without
               discrete clustering of samples. Some body habitats displayed
               bimodal (e.g., gut) or multimodal (e.g., vagina) distributions
               of sample abundances, but not all clustering methods and
               workflows accurately highlight such clusters. Because
               identifying enterotypes in datasets depends not only on the
               structure of the data but is also sensitive to the methods
               applied to identifying clustering strength, we recommend that
               multiple approaches be used and compared when testing for

abstract = {We address the problem of learning topic hierarchies from data. The model selection problem in this domain is daunting—which of the large collection of possible trees to use? We take a Bayesian approach, generating an appropriate prior via a distribution on partitions that we refer to as the nested Chinese restaurant process. This nonparametric prior allows arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates growing data collections. We build a hierarchical topic model by combining this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation. We illustrate our approach on simulated data and with an application to the modeling of NIPS abstracts.},
