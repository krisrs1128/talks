               rRNA and metagenomic sequencing data is difficult due to their
               sparse nature. In this article, we propose using copula models
               with mixed zero-beta margins for the estimation of taxon-taxon
               covariations using data of normalized microbial relative
               abundances. Copulas allow for separate modeling of the
               dependence structure from the margins, marginal covariate
               adjustment, and uncertainty measurement. RESULTS: Our method
               shows that a two-stage maximum-likelihood approach provides
               accurate estimation of model parameters. A corresponding
               two-stage likelihood ratio test for the dependence parameter is
               derived and is used for constructing covariation networks.
               Simulation studies show that the test is valid, robust, and more

               such data makes it a challenge to extract biological
               information. We developed staNMF, a method that combines a
               scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization
               (NMF) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion.
               When applied to a set ofDrosophilaearly embryonic spatial gene
               expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind,

               ofDrosophilaexpression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map

               We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a
               computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Variable selection on high throughput biological
               data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms
               (SNPs), becomes inevitable to select relevant information and,
               therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic
               structure. There are different ways to perform variable
               selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly
               used to identify differentially expressed features for
               explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper
               approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of
               multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use
               multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into
               cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits. RESULTS: A
               simple extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is
               proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass
               classification framework. CONCLUSIONS: sPLS-DA has a
               classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse
               discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and SNP
               data sets. More importantly, sPLS-DA is clearly competitive in
               terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of
               interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs.

               many microbiome analysis goals can be formulated as latent

               varying abundances and is shown to be associated with many
               diseases. An important first step in many microbiome studies is
               to identify possible distinct microbial communities in a given
               data set and to identify the important bacterial taxa that
               characterize these communities. The data from typical microbiome
               studies are high dimensional count data with excessive zeros due
               to both absence of species (structural zeros) and low sequencing
               depth or dropout. Although methods have been developed for
               identifying the microbial communities based on mixture models of
               counts, these methods do not account for excessive zeros
               observed in the data and do not differentiate structural from

               Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and allows for zero inflation

               cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer
               pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different
               cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell
               cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile
               change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis
               further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent
               spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We
               envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved,
               genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and
               accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions
               ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the
               development of cell fate and organization in tissues.",

               kinetic inter- and intracellular interactions that control
               biological systems. Matrix factorization (MF) techniques can
               reveal low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data that
               reflect these interactions. These techniques can uncover new
               biological knowledge from diverse high-throughput omics data in
               applications ranging from pathway discovery to timecourse
               analysis. We review exemplary applications of MF for
               systems-level analyses. We discuss appropriate applications of
               these methods, their limitations, and focus on the analysis of
               results to facilitate optimal biological interpretation. The
               inference of biologically relevant features with MF enables
               discovery from high-throughput data beyond the limits of current

  abstract  = "Significance Biological samples are often heterogeneous mixtures
               of different types of cells. Suppose we have two single-cell
               datasets, each providing information on a different cellular
               feature and generated on a different sample from this mixture.
               Then, the clustering of cells in the two samples should be
               coupled as both clusterings are reflecting the underlying cell
               types in the same mixture. This ``coupled clustering'' problem
               is a new problem not covered by existing clustering methods. In
               this paper, we develop an approach for its solution based on the
               coupling of two nonnegative matrix factorizations. The method
               should be useful for integrative single-cell genomics analysis
               tasks such as the joint analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing
               and single-cell ATAC-sequencing data.",
