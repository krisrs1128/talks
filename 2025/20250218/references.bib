  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing data lie at the heart of modern
               microbiome research. Effective analysis of these data requires
               careful preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation to detect
               subtle signals and avoid spurious associations. In this review,
               we discuss how simulation can serve as a sandbox to test
               candidate approaches, creating a setting that mimics real data
               while providing ground truth. This is particularly valuable for
               power analysis, methods benchmarking, and reliability analysis.
               We explain the probability, multivariate analysis, and
               regression concepts behind modern simulators and how different
               implementations make trade-offs between generality,
               faithfulness, and controllability. Recognizing that all
               simulators only approximate reality, we review methods to
               evaluate how accurately they reflect key properties. We also
               present case studies demonstrating the value of simulation in
               differential abundance testing, dimensionality reduction,
               network analysis, and data integration. Code for these examples

  abstract  = "AbstractHere, we investigate whether (and how) experimental
               design could aid in the estimation of the precision matrix in a
               Gaussian chain graph model, especially the interplay between the
               design, the effect of the experiment and prior knowledge about
               the effect. Estimation of the precision matrix is a fundamental
               task to infer biological graphical structures like microbial
               networks. We compare the marginal posterior precision of the
               precision matrix under four priors: flat, conjugate
               Normal-Wishart, Normal-MGIG and a general independent. Under the
               flat and conjugate priors, the Laplace-approximated posterior
               precision is not a function of the design matrix rendering
               useless any efforts to find an optimal experimental design to
               infer the precision matrix. In contrast, the Normal-MGIG and
               general independent priors do allow for the search of optimal
               experimental designs, yet there is a sharp upper bound on the
               information that can be extracted from a given experiment. We
               confirm our theoretical findings via a simulation study
               comparing (i) the KL divergence between prior and posterior and
               (ii) the Stein's loss difference of MAPs between random and no
               experiment. Our findings provide practical advice for domain
               scientists conducting experiments to better infer the precision
               matrix as a representation of a biological network.",

  abstract  = "Bacterial microbiota play a critical role in mediating local and
               systemic immunity, and shifts in these microbial communities
               have been linked to impaired outcomes in critical illness.
               Emerging data indicate that other intestinal organisms,
               including bacteriophages, viruses of eukaryotes, fungi, and
               protozoa, are closely interlinked with the bacterial microbiota
               and their host, yet their collective role during antibiotic
               perturbation and critical illness remains to be elucidated. We
               employed multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) to systematically
               integrate the bacterial (16S rRNA), fungal (intergenic
               transcribed spacer 1 rRNA), and viral (virus discovery
               next-generation sequencing) components of the intestinal
               microbiota of 33 critically ill patients with and without sepsis
               and 13 healthy volunteers. In addition, we quantified the
               absolute abundances of bacteria and fungi using 16S and 18S rRNA
               PCRs and characterized the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
               butyrate, acetate, and propionate using nuclear magnetic
               resonance spectroscopy. We observe that a loss of the anaerobic
               intestinal environment is directly correlated with an overgrowth
               of aerobic pathobionts and their corresponding bacteriophages as
               well as an absolute enrichment of opportunistic yeasts capable
               of causing invasive disease. We also observed a strong depletion
               of SCFAs in both disease states, which was associated with an
               increased absolute abundance of fungi with respect to bacteria.
               Therefore, these findings illustrate the complexity of
               transkingdom changes following disruption of the intestinal
               bacterial microbiome.IMPORTANCE While numerous studies have
               characterized antibiotic-induced disruptions of the bacterial
               microbiome, few studies describe how these disruptions impact
               the composition of other kingdoms such as viruses, fungi, and
               protozoa. To address this knowledge gap, we employed MOFA to
               systematically integrate viral, fungal, and bacterial sequence
               data from critically ill patients (with and without sepsis) and
               healthy volunteers, both prior to and following exposure to
               broad-spectrum antibiotics. In doing so, we show that modulation
               of the bacterial component of the microbiome has implications
               extending beyond this kingdom alone, enabling the overgrowth of
               potentially invasive fungi and viruses. While numerous
               preclinical studies have described similar findings in vitro, we
               confirm these observations in humans using an integrative
               analytic approach. These findings underscore the potential value
               of multi-omics data integration tools in interrogating how
               different components of the microbiota contribute to disease
               states. In addition, our findings suggest that there is value in
               further studying potential adjunctive therapies using anaerobic
               bacteria or SCFAs to reduce fungal expansion after antibiotic
               exposure, which could ultimately lead to improved outcomes in
               the intensive care unit (ICU).",

               statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small
               subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') to explain or
               predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of
               'omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and
               consider each biological feature independently. We introduce
               mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of
               biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration,
               dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems
               biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods
               that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe
               relationships between heterogeneous 'omics data sets. Our recent
               methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for
               discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple
               'omics data or across independent studies, and for the
               identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest
               mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of
               'omics data available from the package.",

  abstract  = "Recent biotechnology advances allow for multiple types of omics
               data, such as transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data sets
               to be integrated. The problem of feature selection has been
               addressed several times in the context of classification, but
               needs to be handled in a specific manner when integrating data.
               In this study, we focus on the integration of two-block data
               that are measured on the same samples. Our goal is to combine
               integration and simultaneous variable selection of the two data
               sets in a one-step procedure using a Partial Least Squares
               regression (PLS) variant to facilitate the biologists'
               interpretation. A novel computational methodology called
               ;;sparse PLS`` is introduced for a predictive analysis to deal
               with these newly arisen problems. The sparsity of our approach
               is achieved with a Lasso penalization of the PLS loading vectors
               when computing the Singular Value Decomposition. Sparse PLS is
               shown to be effective and biologically meaningful. Comparisons
               with classical PLS are performed on a simulated data set and on
               real data sets. On one data set, a thorough biological
               interpretation of the obtained results is provided. We show that
               sparse PLS provides a valuable variable selection tool for
               highly dimensional data sets.",

  author    = "Meinshausen, Nicolai and B{\"u}hlmann, Peter",
  abstract  = "The pattern of zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of
               a multivariate normal distribution corresponds to conditional
               independence restrictions between variables. Covariance
               selection aims at estimating those structural zeros from data.
               We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a
               computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance
               selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood
               selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions
               separately for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to
               variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show that the
               proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse
               high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the
               penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does
               not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling
               instead the probability of falsely joining some distinct
               connectivity components of the graph, consistent estimation for
               sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when
               the number of variables grows as the number of observations
