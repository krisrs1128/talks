  abstract  = "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a health problem worldwide, and
               elevated cholesterol levels are a key risk factor for the
               disease. Dysbiotic gut microbiota has been shown to be
               associated with CVD development. However, the beneficial effects
               of healthy microbiota in decreasing cholesterol levels have not
               been summarized. Herein, we begin by discussing the potential
               mechanisms by which the gut microbiota reduces cholesterol
               levels. We further sketch the application of probiotics from the
               genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in reducing cholesterol
               levels in clinical studies. Finally, we present the
               cholesterol-lowering function of beneficial commensal microbes,
               such as Akkermansia and Bacteroides spp., as these microbes have
               potential to be the next-generation probiotics (NGPs). The
               information reviewed in this paper will help people to
               understand how the gut microbiome might alter cholesterol
               metabolism and enable the development of NGPs to prevent and
               treat CVD.",
