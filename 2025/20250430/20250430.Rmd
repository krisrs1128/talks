### Model

Topic models suppose that samples $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ are drawn independently:
\begin{align*}
x_i \vert \gamma_i &\sim \text{Mult}\left(n_{i}, \*B\gamma_{i}\right) \\
\gamma_{i} &\sim \text{Dir}\left(\lambda_{\gamma} 1_{K}\right)
\end{align*}
where the columns $\beta_{k}$ of $\*B \in \Delta^{K}_{D}$ lie in the $D$-dimensional simplex and are themselves drawn independently from,
\begin{align*}
\beta_{k} \sim \text{Dir}\left(\lambda_{\beta} 1_{D}\right).
\end{align*}

We vertically stack the $N$ $\gamma_i$'s into $\Gamma \in \Delta^{N}_{K}$.

---

### Simplex View

This model considers two sets of mixtures simultaneously.

* Memberships: $\gamma_{i}$ describes sample $x_i$ as a mixture of topics.
* Topics: $\beta_{k}$ describes the composition of topic $k$.

### Example: Gut Microbiome

If we use topic models, we can see that <span style="color: #476b57;">Topic 2</span> increases during the antibiotic interventions,
especially the first `r Citep(bib, "Sankaran2018")`.

]

---

### Example: Gut Microbiome

We can interpret topics by looking for representative taxa. These are species
that have much higher probabilities in one topic compared to the others.

### Choice of $K$

> However, we stress that care should be taken in the interpretation of the
inferred value of $K$. To begin with, due to the very high dimensionality of the
parameter space, we found it difficult to obtain reliable estimates of
$P\left(X \vert K\right)$... There are also biological reasons to be careful
interpreting $K$.

-- From `r Citep(bib, "Pritchard2000")`.

In practice, it's common to check results and goodness-of-fit measures across
many $K$ `r Citep(bib, c("Novembre2016", "Wallach2009EvaluationMF", "Lawson2018"))`.

---

### `alto`: Main Idea

We will fit an ensemble of models of varying complexities. Then,
post-estimation, we will build a compact representation of the result.

.center[
```{r, out.width = 750}
include_graphics("figure/alto_sketches_annotated alignment.png")
```

<span style="font-size: 20px;">
In the Sankey diagram, columns are models and rectangles are topics.
</span>
]

---

### Alignment as a Graph

We view an alignment as a graph across the ensemble. Index models by $m$ and
topics by $k$. Then,
* Nodes $V$ describe topics, parameterized by $\{\beta^m_{k}, \gamma^m_{k}\}$.
* Edges $E$ link topics from neighboring models, i.e. $K$ to $K + 1$.
* Weights $W$ encode the similarity between topics.

```{r, out.width = 560}
include_graphics("figure/alto_sketches_annotated alignment.png")
```

---

### Notation

This graph-based view provides a convenient notation,

* $m\left(v\right)$ is the model for node $v$
* $k\left(v\right)$ is the topic for node $v$
* $\Gamma\left(v\right) := \left(\gamma_{ v\left(k\right)}^m\left(k\right)\right) \in \reals^n_{+}$ is the vector of
mixed memberships for topic $v$
* $\beta\left(v\right) := \beta_{k}^m \in \Delta^{D}$ is the
corresponding topic distribution
* $e = \left(v, v'\right)$ is an edge linking topics $v$ and $v'$.

```{r, out.width = 560}
include_graphics("figure/alto_sketches_annotated alignment.png")
```

---

### Estimating Weights

Let $V_p$ and $V_q$ be two subsets of topics within the graph.

* Let the total "mass" of $V_p$ be $p = \left\{\Gamma\left(v\right)^T 1 : v \in V_{p}\right\}$. Define $q$ similarly.
* Define the transport cost $C\left(v, v^\prime\right) := JSD\left(\beta\left(v\right), \beta\left(v^\prime\right)\right)$, the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the pair of topic distributions `r Citep(bib, "https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1803.00567")`.

```{r out.width = 420}
include_graphics("figure/transport_alignment_conceptual.png")
```

---

### Estimating Weights


The weights $W$ can be estimated by solving the optimal transport problem,
\begin{align*}
&\min_{W \in \mathcal{U}\left(p, q\right)} \left<C,W\right>
\end{align*}
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{U}\left(p, q\right) := &\{W\in \mathbb{R}^{\left|V_{p}\right| \times \left|V_{q}\right|}_{+} : W 1_{\left|V_{q}\right|} = p \text{ and } W^{T} 1_{\left|V_{p}\right|} = q\}.
\end{align*}
</span>

```{r, out.width = 420}

```

### Diagnostics

* Paths: Partitions the Sankey diagram into connected sets of topics.
* Coherence: Measures transience of a topic along its path.
* Refinement: Reflects degree of mixing between descendant topics.

## Topic Alignment: Examples
]

---

### True Model

Sanity check - What is the alignment when data are generated from a topic model?
Can you guess the true $K$?

* $N = 250, D = 1000, \lambda_{\gamma} = 0.5, \lambda_{\beta} = 0.1$

```{r, out.width = 480}
include_graphics("figure/transport-true-lda.png")
```

---

### Diagnostics

The diagnostics suggest that the true $K$ is 5.

```{r}
include_graphics("figure/lda-combined.png")
```

---

### Model with background variation

Can we detect systematic departures from the assumed model?  Consider the
following generative mechanism,

\begin{align*}
x_{i} \vert \*B, \gamma_{i}, \nu_i &\sim \Mult\left(n_{i}, \alpha \*B\gamma_{i} + \left(1 - \alpha\right)\nu_i\right) \\
\nu_{i} &\sim \Dir\left(\lambda_{\nu}\right) \\
\gamma_i &\sim \Dir\left(\lambda_{\gamma}\right) \\
\beta_{k} &\sim \Dir\left(\lambda_{\beta}\right),
\end{align*}

where $\*B$ stacks the $\beta_k$ rowwise.

---

### Result

The alignment structure is sensitive to changes in $\alpha$ and fragments when
structure is not present.

```

### Data Analysis Background

.pull-left[
`r Citep(bib, "Ravel2010")` used clustering to identify 5 Community State Types (CSTs) in
the vaginal microbiome.
  - Four healthy CSTs are dominated by Lactobacillus variants.
  - A fifth dysbiotic CST is more compositionally diverse and has been
  implicated in preterm birth `r Citep(bib, c("Fettweis2019", "Gudnadottir2022"))` and HIV transmission `r Citep(bib, "Gosmann2017")`.

.pull-right[
  <img src="figure/community_state_types.jpg" width=380/>
  <span style="font-size: 18px;">

  `r Citep(bib, 'Ravel2010')` grouped samples (columns) into CSTs.
  </span>
]

---

### Deconstructing CSTs

.pull-left[
The follow-up study `r Citep(bib, "Symul2023")` had many more samples than `r Citep(bib, 'Ravel2010')` and so could begin to tease additional structure lying
behind CSTs.

* They had 2179 samples from 135 women, sampled longitudinally.
* The green and blue paths to the right reflect the known Lactobacillus CSTs.

### Coherence Scores

.pull-left[
* Overlaying coherence scores onto the alignment, we can distinguish distinguish
between high and low-coherence topics.

* Coherence is not a simple function of $K$ alone.

### Time Series

Like in the antibiotics study, we can visualize change in topics over time. This
highlights smooth transitions in topic memberships.

### Software

Topic alignment is implemented in the R package [alto](https://lasy.github.io/alto).

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(purrr)
library(alto)

# Define LDA parameters
params <- map(
  set_names(1:10),
  ~ list(k = .)
)
models <- run_lda_models(
  vm_data$counts,
  params
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Run alignment
result <- align_topics(models, method = "transport")
plot(result)
```
]

All the simulations discussed today are vignettes in the package.

---

### Takeaways

Topic alignment is a simple but useful addition to the exploratory data analysis
toolbox for count data.

### Paths

For each $v$, identify the incoming edge with the highest normalized weight,
\begin{align*}
  e^\ast\left(v\right) = \arg \max_{e : \text{target}\left(e\right) = v} \tilde{w}_{\text{out}}\left(e\right) + \tilde{w}_{\text{in}}\left(e\right).
\end{align*}

* Iterate this process from large to small $l$ to construct a set of distinct paths along the alignment
* The number of unique paths is a useful property of an alignment

### Coherence

Coherence quantifies a topic's average connectedness to other topics along the same path,

\begin{align*}
 c(v) = \frac{1}{|\text{Path}\left(v\right)|} \sum_{v' \in \text{Path}\left(v\right)} \min\left(\win\left(v, v'\right), \wout\left(v, v'\right) \right)
\end{align*}

* Transient topics (appearing at one $K$ and disappearing at
 another) have low coherence scores
* Consistently recovered topics across choices of $K$ have high coherence

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width=250}
#include_graphics("figure/coherence-sketch.png")
```
]

---

### Refinement

Parent specificity identifies two distinct regimes,

* High Refinement: Each topic receives the most mass from a unique parent,
corresponding to a true or "compromise" topic
* Low Refinement: Each topic receives substantial mass from several parents,
each corresponding to an arbitrary split of a true topic

```{r, out.width=350}
include_graphics("figure/refinement_diagnostic_example.png")
```

---

### Refinement

* High Refinement: Each topic receives the most mass from a unique parent,
corresponding to a true or "compromise" topic
* Low Refinement: Each topic receives substantial mass from several parents,
each corresponding to an arbitrary split of a true topic


\begin{align*}
  r(v)=\frac{\left|V_{m}\right|}{M-m} \sum_{m^{\prime}=m+1}^{M} \sum_{v_{m^{\prime}}^{\prime} \in V_{m^{\prime}}} \wout \left(v, v_{m^{\prime}}^{\prime}\right) \win\left(v, v_{m^{\prime}}^{\prime}\right)
\end{align*}

---

The diagnostics become more reliable as the sample size increases.
