### Cancer Microbiome Controversy `r Citep(bib, "retraction2024")`

.center[
    <img src="figures/retraction.png"/>
]

In June 2024, Nature retracted a paper `r Citep(bib, "Poore2020")` the claimed
identify microbiome signatures of cancer. This came after one year's worth of
debate `r Citep(bib, c("Gihawi2023", "SepichPoore2023", "SepichPoore2024"))`
about the data analysis.

---

### Cancer Microbiome Controversy `r Citep(bib, "retraction2024")`

.center[
    <img src="figures/retraction.png"/>
]

The "disease signature" was an artifact resulting from the use of a batch effect
correction method.  Before we can understand the nuances of the story, we need
to learn about batch effects and correction methods.

---

### Sources of Technical Variation

There are many points at which technical variation arises. For example, for single-cell sequencing `r Citep(bib, "jiang2022statistics")`:
.pull-left[
* Sample Collection
* Sample Storage
* Library Preparation
* cDNA Synthesis
]

.pull-right[
* PCR Amplification
* Sequencing
* Read Assignment
]

Differences at any step can lead to systematic differences between data
collected across experimental runs ("batches"). This is especially problematic
for studies with large sample sizes or multiple study sites.

## Methods
]

---

### General Strategies

1. Correct: Subtract the batch effects before all other analysis.
1. Account: Directly model batch-to-batch variation in the analysis.

|  | Pros | Cons |
|--|---|---|
| Correct | Generality. Can be reused easily. | Can introduce its own artifacts. |
| Account | Cohesion. Only one method needed for everything.  | Time consuming. Bespoke development for each context. |

We will review correction methods.

---

### Correction Methods

.pull-left[
Any method must define,
1. Transformations: How might batch effects impact measurement?
1. Objective: How can we find the most plausible transformation for our data?
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/batch_transformation.png"/>
]

The best choice can depend on properties of the data and the experimental
design, which is why there are so many available methods.

---

### Exemplar Methods

In this overview, we'll consider,

1. ComBat `r Citep(bib, "Johnson2006")` (2007). Linear Model.
1. CellAnova `r Citep(bib, "Zhang2024")` (2024). Embeddings + Linear Model.

---

### ComBat - Setting

ComBat was proposed to remove batch effects in microarray data with small sample
sizes, $n \approx 5 - 20$ per batch, and it has inspired many variants.

1. $\*y_i \in \reals^{G}$: Sample $i$'s expression levels across $G$ genes.
1. $\*x_i \in \reals^{D}$: Potentially relevant biological factors.
1. $m\left(i\right) \in \left[1, \dots, M \right]$: Which of the $M$ batches does sample $i$ belong to?

---

### ComBat - Model

Sample $i$ is assumed to be drawn from:

\begin{align*}
\*y_{i} = \mu + \*W \*x_{i} + \*b_{m(i)} + \Lambda_{m(i)}\*\epsilon_i
\end{align*}

where $\Lambda_{m} = \diag{\delta_{mg}}$ rescales the noise $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \diag{\sigma_g^2}\right)$.

1. The parameters $\*W$ capture shared biological effects.
1. Batch effects cause systematic location-scale shifts.
1. Given $\*b_m$ and $\*\Lambda_{m}$, we can remove their effect from
the observed data.
---

### ComBat - Estimation

Rather than estimating each gene $g$ separately, ComBat uses a hierarchical
model to share information across all genes. This improves stability in the
corrections for genes with very high noise levels.

]
<p class="caption">
By fitting the model simultaneously across genes, the estimates are "shrunk"
towards the mean.

---

### Challenges

Batch effect correction can introduce subtle problems of its own.

**Hypothesis Testing**: When the batches are highly imbalanced, correction can
distort the null distribution of test statistics. This invalidates the usual
$p$-values `r Citep(bib, "Nygaard2015")`.

### Challenges

.pull-three-quarters-left[
**Alignability**: Batch effect correction methods will attempt to match batches
regardless of whether there is actually any shared biology `r Citep(bib, "Ma2024")`.

]

exclude: true

### Challenges

Batch effect correction can introduce subtle problems of its own.

**Supervision**: Methods that use a biological group label can introduce spurious
associations with that label `r Citep(bib, "githubGitHubGtonkinhillTCGA_analysis")`.

.center[
<img src="figures/retraction.png" width = 600/>
]

---

### Sensitivity and Simulation

1. Run the analysis separately across batches. Many of the results should
overlap if the biology is truly shared across batches.

1. Use a simulation to better understand the pipeline. There are many packages
for learning a simulator based on an initial dataset `r Citep(bib, "Sankaran2024")`.

---

### Simulation and Supervised Normalization

Gerry Tonkin-Hill has an excellent re-analysis `r Citep(bib, "githubGitHubGtonkinhillTCGA_analysis")` of the data from `r Citep(bib, "Poore2020")` which sheds light what were likely the source of the phantom signals. The first part is a simulation.

.pull-left[
<img src="figures/gth_sim1.png"/>
]
.pull-right[
<img src="figures/gth_sim2.png"/>
]

---

### Simulation and Supervised Normalization

This setting is balanced -- each condition is equally likely across batches. In
this case, SVN batch effect correction `r Citep(bib, "mecham2010supervised")`
works well.

.pull-left[
<img src="figures/gth_sim3.png"/>
]
.pull-right[
<img src="figures/gth_sim4.png"/>
]

---

### Simulation and Supervised Normalization

But what happens if there is imbalance?

.pull-left[
<img src="figures/gth_sim5.png"/>
]
.pull-right[
<img src="figures/gth_sim6.png"/>
]

---

### Simulation and Supervised Normalization

In this case, the SVN correction introduces an artificial difference.

.center[
<img src="figures/gth_sim7.png" width=500/>
]

This should cause concern about the original analysis: Hospitals specialize in
cancer types. Then again, this simulation is quite unrealistic.

---

### Experimental Design

1. To better account for batch effects, we should think carefully about
replication and controls `r Citep(bib, c("GagnonBartsch2011", "Jacob2015", "Gerard2021"))`.

  - Replication: Generate multiple measurements of the same sample.
  - Controls: Samples or features where the signal is known to be absent.

1. Any variation that is only present after a step of data generation must be
due to the measurement mechanism, rather than the true biology.
---

### CellAnova

1. CellAnova `r Citep(bib, "Zhang2024")` takes this thinking a step further by
formalizing an approach to defining and using control samples.

1. Across all batches, control samples are assumed to have the same underlying
biology, and this gives confidence in the resulting correction.

1. This is a more formal alternative to to maximizing overlap across batches for
each cell type. 

---

### Pool-of-Controls

1. [**Notation**] Let $\*Y^1, ..., \*Y^M$ be measurements across $M$ biological samples. 
  - Let the first $M_0$ samples are controls. 
  - Each $\*Y^m \in \reals^{N_{m} \times G}$.
2. [**Controls**] The control samples are assumed to be biologically comparable
  - Time course: All pre-treatment samples
  - Multi-omics: All healthy subjects regardless of sequencing technology

---

### Assumed Model

\begin{align*}
\bm{Y}^m &= \bm{C}^m(\mu + \bm{X}^m \bm{W}^\top + \bm{B}^m \bm{V}^\top) + \text{noise} \\\\
&:= \bm{C}^m \left(\bm{R}^m\right)^\top + \text{noise}
\end{align*}

As input, we expect:
- $\*C^m$: Cell-level encodings (e.g., cell types) in sample $m$

We want to estimate:
- $\mu$: Global mean
- $\*B^m \*V^\top$: Batch effects
- $\*X^m \*W^\top$: Real biological variation

---

### CellAnova: Detect Batch Effects

**Step 1**: Estimate the batch effects subspace,
\begin{align}
\left[\bm{R}^1-\overline{\bm{R}}^0 \;\; \cdots \;\; \bm{R}^{M_0}-\overline{\bm{R}}^0\right]^\top \in \reals^{K_c M_0 \times G} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{SVD}} \bm{V} \in \reals^{G \times K_b}
\end{align}
This should reflect hospital, technician, or platform-level effects.

**Step 2**: Evaluate the coordinates of each sample with respect to this subspace,
\begin{align}
\bm{B}^m=\left(\bm{R}^m-\overline{\bm{R}}\right) \bm{V}
\end{align}

---

### Decomposing Variation: Biology

**Step 3**: Project out the batch effects and identify a subspace spanning the remaining variation:

\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} \bm{R}^1 - \overline{\bm{R}} \\\\ \vdots \\\\ \bm{R}^M - \overline{\bm{R}} \end{bmatrix}(I - \bm{V}\bm{V}^\top) \xrightarrow{\text{SVD}} \bm{W}
\end{align}

Then $\bm{X}^m = (\bm{R}^m - \overline{\bm{R}})\bm{W}$ are coordinates with respect to real
biological variation.

---

### CellAnova vs. ComBat

The CellAnova paper uses notation that stacks the expressions like those we saw
in ComBat.
\begin{align}
\bm{y}_i = \mu + \bm{W} \bm{x}_i + \bm{b}_m + \Lambda_m \epsilon_i
\end{align}
vs.
\begin{align}
\bm{Y} = \bm{C}\left(\mu + \bm{X} \bm{W}^\top + \bm{B} \bm{V}^\top\right) + \text{noise}
\end{align}

Both methods shed light on why batch effects appears.

---

### Takeaways

1. **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: If the main source of variation in the data comes
from batch effects, then even the most sophisticated methodology will fail to
discover interesting biology.

1. **Approaches**: Correction methods estimate batch-specific transformations of
shared biology. These transformations are then reversed to define the
correction.

1. **Checks**: It's important not to use batch effect correction methods
thoughtlessly.  Consider applying simulation and leveraging the experimental
design.

To dispute a scientific fact, a dissenter can always argue that the
conditions that led to its production are not generalizable. To guard against
this, we need to understand batch-to-batch variation.
