  abstract  = "Direct manipulation has been lauded as a good form of interface
               design, and some interfaces that have this property have been
               well received by users. In this article we seek a cognitive
               account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct
               manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena
               that give rise to the feeling of directness. One deals with the
               information processing distance between the user's intentions
               and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this
               distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort
               required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon
               concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies
               of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation
               requires that the system provide representations of objects that
               behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the
               feeling of directness of manipulation.",

  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing data lie at the heart of modern
               microbiome research. Effective analysis of these data requires
               careful preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation to detect
               subtle signals and avoid spurious associations. In this review,
               we discuss how simulation can serve as a sandbox to test
               candidate approaches, creating a setting that mimics real data
               while providing ground truth. This is particularly valuable for
               power analysis, methods benchmarking, and reliability analysis.
               We explain the probability, multivariate analysis, and
               regression concepts behind modern simulators and how different
               implementations make trade-offs between generality,
               faithfulness, and controllability. Recognizing that all
               simulators only approximate reality, we review methods to
               evaluate how accurately they reflect key properties. We also
               present case studies demonstrating the value of simulation in
               differential abundance testing, dimensionality reduction,
               network analysis, and data integration. Code for these examples
               is available in an online tutorial (https://go.wisc.edu/8994yz)

               techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing
               phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across
               diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community
               structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental
               conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals
               to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of
               underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these
               datasets present several technical challenges. First, the
               abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from
               amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized
               to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial
               abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical
               metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU
               relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial
               sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on
               only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU
               association networks is severely under-powered, and additional
               information (or assumptions) are required for accurate
               inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE
               Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a
               statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological
               networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both
               of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations
               developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model
               inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological
               association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network,
               SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and
               inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark
               in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard
               network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational
               tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse
               underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms
               state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties
               on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also
               reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations
               using data from the American Gut project.",
