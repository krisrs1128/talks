  author    = "Hutchins, Edwin L and Hollan, James D and Norman, Donald A",
  abstract  = "Direct manipulation has been lauded as a good form of interface
               design, and some interfaces that have this property have been
               well received by users. In this article we seek a cognitive
               account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct
               manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena
               that give rise to the feeling of directness. One deals with the
               information processing distance between the user's intentions
               and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this
               distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort
               required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon
               concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies
               of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation
               requires that the system provide representations of objects that
               behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the
               feeling of directness of manipulation.",
