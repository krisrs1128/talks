### Microbiome Data Science

The goal of my lab is to help microbiome researchers get the most out of their
data. The essential statistical questions are:

* **Integration**: How should we analyze data gathered from multiple batches or
technologies?

* **Experimental Design**: How should we design microbiome experiments to 
accelerate engineering or medical applications?

* **Reproducibility**: How can we be sure our conclusions are trustworthy?

We work directly with microbiologists on problems related to HIV, the gut-brain
axis, and synthetic communities.

### Problem Solving

To solve these problems, we draw from classic ideas from statistics and computing:

* **Simulation**: It's easier to design experiments and benchmark methods when
we can quickly generate realistic data.

* **Visualization**: A good interface can shape the way we think for the better,
helping us be more critical and creative.

### Themes: Visualization

In `r Citep(bib, "Fukuyama2022")`, we studied navigation across ensembles of topic models.

In the Sankey diagram, columns are models and rectangles are topics.

### Themes: Visualization

The patterns of flow on this diagram are useful for deciding on the number of
topics present in a dataset.

### Themes: Visualization

In `r Citep(bib, "distortions")`, we used the focus-plus-context principle to
interactively explore how dimensionality reduction methods like UMAP distort the
intrinsic geometry of the data.

### Themes: Simulation

We wrote a review paper on designing simulators for microbiome data 
`r Citep(bib, "Sankaran2024")` and are actively developing new methods and
software on this theme.

### Themes: Simulation

Being able to faithfully emulate real data with controllable simulators can
guide power analysis, benchmark competing methods, and support sanity checks.

### Collaborations with Biologists

* Environmental Viral Dynamics [Anantharaman Lab, UWM]: Viruses are the most
abundant biological entities on the planet. We are helping analyze temporal data
to characterize environmental phage dynamics.

* HIV Risk Factors [Kwon Lab, Ragon Institute]: The microbiome is closely
related to immunity. We are using data to understand HIV risk from multi-omics
data.

* Mental Health and the Microbiome [Handelsman Lab, UWM]: Specific microbes have
been linked to mood disorders. We are part of a multi-institute collaboration to
better understand these gut-brain connections.
